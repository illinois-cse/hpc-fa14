{"name":"HPC-Fa14","tagline":"CSE Training Workshops in HPC Tools, Fall 2014 • DCL L440, 9–11 am","body":"All workshops will be held in L440 Digital Computer Laboratory, an EWS computer laboratory in the basement.  There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to The Linux Command Line (Bash Shell)](#bash)\r\n### Sep. 19, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n### Oct. 17, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis class will introduce the basic Linux environment, commands, and the elements of scripting.  Scripting is a powerful way to make your data analysis consistent, reproducible, and archivable, saving you time and effort in your research.\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to Scientific Computing on Illinois Campus Cluster](#hpc)\r\n### Sep. 26, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n### Oct. 24, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis workshop will introduce the elements of scientific computing, such as numerical programming basics, navigating and working on a cluster (the Illinois Campus Cluster), and managing jobs and files effectively.\r\n\r\nDon't miss the National Center for Supercomputing Applications' [Petascale Day](http://petascale.ncsa.illinois.edu/) held annually on 10/15 from 3–6 pm.  You can tour the physical facility and the National Petascale Computing Facility (Oak St & St Mary's) and see what a supercomputer cluster and storage system looks like, as well as view 3D scientific visualizations at NCSA.\r\n\r\n# [MPI for Engineers](#mpi)\r\n### Oct. 3, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n### Oct. 31, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThe [Message-Passing Interface](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/) is the _de facto_ standard for all large-scale distributed-memory cluster computing.  We will examine the basics of this standard in C, C++, and Fortran, as well as discuss some numerical coding applications and considerations.\r\n\r\n# [OpenMP for Engineers](#omp)\r\n### Oct. 10, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n### Nov. 7, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n[OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/) is a set of extensions to the C, C++, and Fortran languages to allow the effective control of multiple cores on shared-memory machines, such as desktop computers or single nodes of supercomputers.  With a few well-placed annotations and some judicious restructuring of your current code, you can start seeing speedups from effectively using multiple processes immediately.  We will discuss the basics of OpenMP and examine some applications as well.\r\n# [Python MPI4Py](#mpi4py)\r\n### Oct. 8, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [MATLAB Distributed](#matlabdist)\r\n### Oct. 16, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# About These Workshops\r\n### Contributors\r\nNeal Davis developed these materials.
