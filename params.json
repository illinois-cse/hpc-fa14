Scripting is a powerful way to make your data analysis consistent, reproducible, and archivable, saving you time and effort in your research.\r\n\r\n[Exercises and Notes](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/hpc-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/bash-exercises.md)\r\n\r\nPlease extract the data files to your desktop or home directory, and within the data directory execute the folder script.  (We will do this together at the beginning of class.)\r\n\r\n[Folder script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/hpc-fa14/gh-pages/lessons/make-dirs.sh) (right-click and _Save As..._)\r\n\r\n[Data files](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/hpc-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/data.zip?raw=true) (right-click and _Save As..._)\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to Scientific Computing on Illinois Campus Cluster](#hpc)\r\n### Sep. 26, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n### Oct. 24, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis workshop will introduce the elements of scientific computing, such as numerical programming basics, navigating and working on a cluster (the Illinois Campus Cluster), and managing jobs and files effectively.\r\n\r\nDon't miss the National Center for Supercomputing Applications' [Petascale Day](http://petascale.ncsa.illinois.edu/) held annually on 10/15 from 3–6 pm.  You can tour the physical facility and the National Petascale Computing Facility (Oak St & St Mary's) and see what a supercomputer cluster and storage system looks like, as well as view 3D scientific visualizations at NCSA.\r\n\r\nPlease right-click and _Save As..._ the following IPython notebook to your home directory or desktop.\r\n\r\n[Numerical Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/hpc-fa14/gh-pages/lessons/numerical-error.ipynb)\r\n\r\n`wget https://github.com/uiuc-cse/hpc-fa14/raw/gh-pages/data/hpc-src.tar.gz`\r\n\r\n# [MPI for Engineers](#mpi)\r\n### Oct. 3, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n### Oct. 31, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThe [Message-Passing Interface](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/) is the _de facto_ standard for all large-scale distributed-memory cluster computing.  We will examine the basics of this standard in C (and can touch on C++ and Fortran), as well as discuss some numerical coding applications and considerations.  Programming experience with C is assumed.\r\n\r\n# [OpenMP for Engineers](#omp)\r\n### Oct. 10, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n### Nov. 7, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n[OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/) is a set of extensions to the C, C++, and Fortran languages to allow the effective control of multiple cores on shared-memory machines, such as desktop computers or single nodes of supercomputers.  With a few well-placed annotations and some judicious restructuring of your current code, you can start seeing speedups from effectively using multiple processes immediately.  We will discuss the basics of OpenMP and examine some applications as well.  Programming experience with C or C++ is assumed.\r\n\r\n# [Python MPI4Py](#mpi4py)\r\n### Oct. 8, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [MATLAB Distributed](#matlabdist)\r\n### Oct. 16, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# About These Workshops\r\n### Contributors\r\nNeal Davis developed these materials.
